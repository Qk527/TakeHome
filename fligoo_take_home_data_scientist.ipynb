    "# The Hotel Bookings Data\n",
    "Letâ€™s use hotel bookings data from [Antonio, Almeida, and Nunes (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191?via%3Dihub) to predict which hotel stays included children and/or babies, based on the other characteristics of the stays such as which hotel the guests stay at, how much they pay, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the hotels (H1) is a resort hotel and the other is a city hotel (H2). Both datasets share the same structure, with 23 variables describing the 19248 observations of H1 and 30752 observations of H2. Each observation represents a hotel booking. Both datasets comprehend bookings due to arrive between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were canceled. Since this is hotel real data, all data elements pertaining hotel or costumer identification were deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Take-Home Goals**\n",
    "- During **Part I** you should perform an Exploratory Data Analisys highlighting key findings:\n",
    "  - Data Quality Check: You must check the quality of the given dataset to make an assessment of how appropriate it is for later Data Science tasks. Propose a set of corrective actions over the data if any.\n",
    "  - Report insights and conclusions: Describe the results obtained during the exploratory analysis and provide conclusions from a business perspective, supported by charts / tables / metrics.\n",
    "- On **Part II** you should define and train a model to predict which actual hotel stays included children/babies, and which did not:\n",
    "  - Feature extraction: Indicate some possible candidates of features that could properly describe the hotels, either from the given columns or from their transformations.\n",
    "  - Machine Learning modeling: at least one fitted model with the given data. You could use the `children` column as target.\n",
    "- Finally, on **Part III** you should present the key findings, conclusions and results to non-technical stakeholders.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Requirements**\n",
    "- Python 3.x & Pandas 1.x or R & Tidyverse & Tidymodels\n",
    "- Paying attention to the details and narrative is far way more important than extensive development.\n",
    "- Once you complete the assessment, please send a ZIP file of the folder with all the resources used in this work (e.g. Jupyter notebook, Python scripts, text files, images, etc) or share the repository link.\n",
    "- Have a final meeting with the team to discuss the work done in this notebook and answer the questions that could arise.\n",
    "- Finally, but most important: Have fun!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nice to have aspects**\n",
    "- Dockerfile to setup environment / Conda environment for isolation.\n",
    "- Code versioning with Git (you are free to publish it on your own Github/Bitbucket account!).\n",
    "- Show proficiency in Python: By showing good practices in the structure and documentation, usage of several programming paradigms (e.g. imperative, OOP, functional), etc.\n"
